The cost for vertical and horizontal actions is 1, and the cost of diagonal actions is 1.4, with two exceptions. There are conveyor belts between nodes `(1,0)` and `(1,1)`, and between nodes `(1,2)` and `(2,2)`, reducing the cost of those actions to 0.2. The grid with associated action costs is shown below.\n",
