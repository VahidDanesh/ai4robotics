    "\n",
    "**This homework will be unlike prior homeworks. It will be _entirely_ implementation-based. Some questions will be assessed by running your code, while others will require you to upload trained neural nets, which the grader will evaluate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Neural net implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step will be to create a neural net implementation, including training code. This part will be agnostic to the robotics problem setting: we will simply train a neural net on some arbitrary X, Y dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll use PyTorch, a Python framework for implementing and training neural networks. PyTorch is currently one of the most popular frameworks within the machine learning community, so it's worth becoming familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, PyTorch uses the **Tensor** data type to encode all the objects it works on. In our usage, a tensor is the generalization of the idea of an array (which is typically 2D) to a structure that can have arbitrarily many dimensions. We will use tensors to represent data sets, batches of data, weights, activations, etc. They are very versatile but can be a little bit difficult to conceptualize especially when you're starting out. You'll get the hang of it! I recommend looking at this very good [primer on PyTorch tensors](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run locally, you may simply run `pip install torch`; PyTorch is already installed in Google Colab. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch creates networks in a modular fashion, by chaining different [torch.nn.Modules](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) together. Some helpful modules for this assignment include:\n",
    "- [nn.Linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) -- implements (the pre-activations for) a fully-connected layer, what we call $W^\\top x + b$.\n",
    "- [nn.ReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html) -- implements ReLU activation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this question, you can use the dataset in `dummy_data.pt`, included with this assignment. You may load this file using `data = torch.load(\"dummy_data.pt\")`, which will return dictionary of the form: `{'inputs_train': X_train, 'outputs_train': Y_train, 'inputs_test': X_test, 'outputs_test': Y_test}`. Inspect the X and Y to determine what the input-output dimensions to your network should be.\n",
