    "One common way to represent 2D robotic navigation problems is to use an occupancy grid. The idea is to represent the world as a matrix of ones and zeros, where a one represents an occupied cell (i.e., an obstacle) and a zero represents a free cell. For example, in the following grid, there are obstacles in cells (0,2), (1,1), (2,3), (3,0), and (3, 2); all other cells are free:\n",

Instead, whenever we inspect a node for its neighbors, we consider only free cells as neighbors. We represent each cell by its coordinates `(i,j)`, where `i` is the row and `j` is the column. To inspect a cell's neighbors, we add/subtract 1 to its `i` or `j` coordinate (or both, if we consider diagonal motions). Care must be taken to ensure that we don't consider cells outside the bounds of the grid. \n",
